This work introduces Algorithm Trading strategies to generate money from estimating on SPTL funds which tracks the 
long-term Treasury bonds. As per research Algorithmic trading involves using computer algorithms to execute trading strategies. 
These algorithms, often fuelled by vast amounts of market data and statistical models, make split-second decisions on 
buying or selling financial instruments. By using historical data from 2014 to 2019, it is examined how various organizations 
can use their initial capital and gross limit (book size) to explore opportunities for maximizing profits. This work has 
established how well the strategies contribute and how possible the risks are. It has also looked at the different implications 
of an interest rate change. For this work we determine concepts such as the daily profit, turnover, and the drawdown (being 
the losses from peak to trough), thus, we shape our way of managing risks and of improving returns. We have adopted a 
simple price-performance metrics like the Sharpe Ratios to gauge performance and the strategies of risk management will 
be discussed based on the variations in the market fluctuations. This report critically analyses strategies for investors to 
make smart decisions regarding ETFs, such as SPTL. It explores various approaches and techniques for optimizing 
investment decisions and maximizing returns in the context of leveraged ETFs.
